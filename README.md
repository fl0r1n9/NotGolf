Aufgabenstellung:

Project B) MazeBall - Game for Mobile Devices
Mobile games are becoming increasingly multimodal. We learned how inertial
measuring units (IMUs) can be used to determine the orientation of a mobile
device. We also learned how to communicate with servers on Android and to
program a game with obstacles. Now, you should be able to develop an online
mobile game. Developers of online games want to include more and more levels
in their game to keep users playing without updating their app. Furthermore,
players are more motivated when there are highscores to compete against. Your
task is to develop a virtual MazeBall game for mobile devices with a highscore
and levels that are provided by a server. Levels should be update after starting
your app. Your task will be to develop such a 2D or 3D game with the following
requirements:

• A Mobile Game Client
o A ball in a maze with a design of your choice
o The ball should be controlled by changing the orientation of your
device
o The game includes holes that reset your game (and time)
o A target to win the game (colored differently)
o Highscore-List that displays the results of the best 10 players of a
level after completing: score = time in seconds, less time is better.
o The player’s name should only be provided at the beginning of the
first game/after install (no registration required)
o The main screen lists all levels (locked and unlocked)
o After starting your game the level list should be updated, so that
the game could be expanded using new levels
o Levels are only unlocked when the level before is completed
o Locked levels are greyed out
• A Highscore/Level Server
o provides the high score for each level
o provides the data structures of at least 5 levels
